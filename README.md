# First Python challenge!

Split into two sub-challenges - PyBank and PyPoll

# File Directory:

Both PyBank and PyPoll have the following folders/files:
    main.py - the main python script
    Resources folder - contains original CSV file
    Analysis folder - contains final summary analysis as text file

# PyBank

Simulation of a financial dataset of profits/losses

Your task is to create a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:

    The total number of months included in the dataset

    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# PyPoll

 Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

    The total number of votes cast

    A complete list of candidates who received votes

    The percentage of votes each candidate won

    The total number of votes each candidate won

    The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
